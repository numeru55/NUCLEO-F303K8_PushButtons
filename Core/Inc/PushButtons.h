 INIT     [A] Initial state
 PRESSED  [B] Pushed any button. Starts time count.
 PRESSING [C] All buttons are pushed, and de-bouced. Return key bit.
		      For example, 0b11 means "2 buttons are pushed in almost same time."
		      0b1 means "Only first buttons are pushed."
 RELEASE  [D] Main Loop initialize key state, and library waits releasing buttons.
 RELEASED [E] Library detects "all the button is releasing."
   n/a    [F] After de-bounced, library goes initial state, [A].

notice: no care for overflow of HAL_GetTick().
